# Prediction Model using Reccurent Neural Network - LSTM

This Program generates data using Prediction model reducing the data generation time when compared to the traditional expermiental data time.

Introduction: Our aim was to find the Impact kinetic energy of a ball travelling at a speed hitting a material to gauge the maximum restrictive potential of the material for which we had data points of the kinetic energy and speeds at every point after hitting the material.

We employed LSTM a recurrent neural network for achieivng precision in results.
